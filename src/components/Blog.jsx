            Q:1- What is an access token and refresh token? How do they work and
            where should we store them on the client-side?
          </p>

          <p className="bg-white p-3 rounded-md mt-4">
            Ans: An access token and a refresh token are two components commonly
            used in authentication and authorization systems. They serve
            different purposes and work together to ensure secure and efficient
            access to resources. 1. Access Token: An access token is a
            credential that represents the authorization granted to a client
            (such as a user or an application) to access specific resources on a
            server. It is typically issued by an authentication server or an
            identity provider after the client successfully authenticates
            itself. Access tokens are time-limited and contain information about
            the client's identity, the requested scope of access, and any
            additional details required by the server. The client presents the
            access token with each request to the server to access protected
            resources. The server verifies the access token's validity, checks
            if it has the necessary permissions, and grants or denies access
            accordingly. 2. Refresh Token: A refresh token is a long-lived
            credential used to obtain a new access token when the current one
            expires. It is usually issued along with the access token and stored
            securely by the client. The server validates the refresh token and,
            if valid, issues a new access token without requiring the user to
            re-authenticate. This process reduces the frequency of user
            interactions for authentication, providing a smoother experience.
            Refresh tokens have a longer lifespan than access tokens, typically
            lasting for days, weeks, or even months. They should be stored
            securely on the client-side, using methods like secure cookies,
            browser storage mechanisms with appropriate security measures, or
            device-specific secure storage systems. In summary, access tokens
            are short-lived credentials used to access protected resources,
            while refresh tokens are long-lived credentials used to obtain new
            access tokens.

          <p className="font-bold">Q:2- Compare SQL and NoSQL databases?</p>

          <p className="bg-white p-3 rounded-md mt-4">
            Ans: SQL (Structured Query Language) and NoSQL (Not only SQL)
            databases are two different types of database systems, each with its
            own characteristics and use cases. Here's a comparison between the
            two:
            <br />
            1. Data Model: - SQL: SQL databases use a structured data model
            known as the relational model. Data is organized into tables with
            predefined schemas, consisting of rows and columns. The
            relationships between tables are defined through primary and foreign
            keys. - NoSQL: NoSQL databases employ various data models, including
            key-value, document, columnar, and graph. They offer flexibility by
            allowing schema-less data structures, making it easier to store and
            retrieve unstructured or semi-structured data.
            <br />
            2. Scalability: SQL: SQL databases traditionally use a vertical
            scaling approach, where the hardware is upgraded to handle the
            increased load. - NoSQL: NoSQL databases are designed to scale
            horizontally. They can distribute data across multiple servers or
            clusters, making them more suitable for handling large-scale
            applications and high volumes of data.
            <br />
            3. Query Language: - SQL: SQL databases use the SQL query language,
            which provides a standardized way to interact with the data using
            declarative statements. SQL offers powerful querying capabilities,
            including joins, aggregations, and complex filtering. - NoSQL: NoSQL
            databases may have their own query languages or APIs specific to the
            data model they employ. While some NoSQL databases support queries
            similar to SQL, others may have more limited querying capabilities,
            focusing on key-based retrieval or document-based queries.
            <br />
            4. ACID Transactions: - SQL: SQL databases generally provide strong
            transactional consistency through ACID (Atomicity, Consistency,
            Isolation, Durability) properties. Transactions ensure data
            integrity by allowing multiple operations to be grouped together as
            an all-or-nothing proposition. - NoSQL: NoSQL databases vary in
            their support for ACID transactions. Some NoSQL databases prioritize
            scalability and availability over strong consistency, offering
            eventual consistency or relaxed transactional guarantees.
            <br />
            5. Use Cases: - SQL: SQL databases excel in scenarios that require
            complex relationships, strict data integrity, and strong
            consistency. - NoSQL: NoSQL databases are well-suited for handling
            unstructured or rapidly changing data, big data processing,
            real-time analytics, and applications with massive scalability
            requirements. It's worth noting that the distinction between SQL and
            NoSQL databases is not absolute, and there are databases that blur
            the lines between the two categories, offering hybrid capabilities
            or bridging the gap with features like JSON support or distributed
            SQL engines.{" "}

          <p className="font-bold">Q:3- What is express js? What is Nest JS?</p>

          <p className="bg-white p-3 rounded-md mt-4">Ans: Express.js and Nest.js are both popular web application frameworks used to build server-side applications. Here's a brief explanation of each:

1. Express.js:
   Express.js is a minimalistic and flexible web application framework for Node.js. It provides a simple and unopinionated approach to building web servers and APIs. Express.js offers a wide range of features and middleware that simplify common tasks such as routing, handling HTTP requests and responses, and managing sessions.
Express.js is known for its simplicity, lightweight nature, and ease of use. It allows developers to quickly set up server-side applications with minimal overhead and provides the freedom to structure and organize code according to individual preferences. It has a large ecosystem of extensions and middleware, enabling developers to add additional functionality as needed.
<br />
2. Nest.js:
   Nest.js is a TypeScript-based server-side framework built on top of Express.js. It aims to provide an opinionated and structured approach to building scalable and maintainable applications. Nest.js incorporates ideas from Angular and embraces a modular architecture and dependency injection. Nest.js introduces decorators and TypeScript decorators to define modules, controllers, services, and other components. It offers features like dependency injection, middleware, decorators for routing, and strong typing with TypeScript. The framework encourages the use of design patterns like MVC (Model-View-Controller) and SOLID principles, promoting code organization and reusability.

Express.js is a minimalistic and flexible web application framework for Node.js, focusing on simplicity and customization. On the other hand, Nest.js is a TypeScript-based server-side framework that builds upon Express.js, offering an opinionated and structured approach with features like decorators, dependency injection, and a modular architecture. Both frameworks have their own strengths and can be chosen based on the specific needs and preferences of the project.</p>

            Q:4- What is MongoDB aggregate and how does it work?
          </p>

          <p className="bg-white p-3 rounded-md mt-4">
            Ans: MongoDB's aggregation framework is a powerful tool that allows
            you to perform advanced data processing and analysis on collections
            of documents. It provides a way to filter, transform, and summarize
            data in a flexible and efficient manner. At its core, the
            aggregation framework works by passing a sequence of stages to the
            `aggregate` method in MongoDB. Each stage performs a specific
            operation on the collection document, and the results of each stage
            are passed to the next stage in the pipeline. <br /> **$match**:
            This stage filters the documents in the collection based on
            specified criteria.It is similar to the query parameter of the
            `find` method and allows you to select documents that match certain
            conditions. <br />
            $group**: This stage groups the documents based on specified fields
            and performs various aggregation operations on them, such as
            calculating sums, averages, or counts. <br /> **$project**: This
            stage reshapes the documents by selecting specific fields, renaming
            fields, adding new fields, or excluding fields altogether. <br />
            **$sort**: This stage sorts the documents based on specified fields
            in ascending or descending order. <br /> **$limit** : These stages
            allow you to limit the number of documents returned by the
            aggregation pipeline and skip a certain number of documents,
            respectively. They are useful for pagination or limiting the result
            set. These are just a few of the stages available in the aggregation
            framework. MongoDB provides many other stages, such as `$lookup` for
            performing joins across collections, `$bucket` for creating buckets
            or histograms, and `$facet` for running multiple pipelines within a
            single aggregation operation.
